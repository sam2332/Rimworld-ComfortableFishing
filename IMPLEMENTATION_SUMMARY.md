# Comfortable Fishing Mod - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a RimWorld mod that provides fishing bonuses when pawns fish from chairs. The mod is designed to work with **any chair from any mod** by detecting the universal `isSittable` property.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Universal Chair Compatibility
- **Detection Method**: Uses `edifice.def.building.isSittable == true`
- **Works with ANY mod**: Automatically detects chairs from all furniture mods
- **No hardcoded chair types**: Future-proof design

### 2. Chair Placement Logic
- **Adjacent to Fishing Zones**: Since chairs cannot be placed in water, they must be adjacent to fishing zones
- **Distance Control**: Configurable maximum distance (0-5 tiles) from fishing zones
- **Zone Validation**: Checks if chair is close to any cell in the fishing zone

### 3. Robust Reservation System
- **Prevents Job Failures**: Thoroughly validates reservations before suggesting chairs
- **Multiple Validation Checks**: Line of sight, reservation availability, and zone proximity
- **Fallback Logic**: Won't suggest chairs if basic reservations fail

### 4. Fishing Bonuses
- **Yield Bonus**: Configurable multiplier (1.0x - 2.0x) for extra fish caught
- **Speed Bonus**: Configurable multiplier (1.0x - 2.0x) for faster fishing
- **Real-time Application**: Bonuses applied during fishing job execution

### 4. User Interface & Settings
- **Mod Settings Menu**: Accessible via Options → Mod Settings → Comfortable Fishing
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle chair fishing bonuses on/off
- **Adjustable Multipliers**: Sliders for yield and speed bonuses
- **Zone Requirements**: Option to require chairs near fishing zones
- **Alert Messages**: Optional "Seated Fishing Bonus Granted" notifications

### 5. Smart Pawn Behavior
- **Chair Preference**: Pawns will prefer chairs when available for fishing
- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically detects when pawns are sitting while fishing
- **Validation**: Only chairs adjacent to fishing zones provide bonuses (if enabled)

## Technical Implementation

### Harmony Patches
1. **JobDriver_Fish.MakeNewToils**: Modifies fishing speed when using chairs
2. **FishingUtility.GetCatchesFor**: Applies yield bonus to fish catches
3. **WorkGiver_Fish.BestStandSpotFor**: Suggests chair positions for fishing

### Chair Detection Logic
- **Sitting Detection**: `!pawn.pather.MovingNow` + `PawnPosture.Standing` + `isSittable` building
- **Zone Proximity**: Checks distance to fishing zone cells
- **Validation**: Ensures chair is accessible and not forbidden

### Configuration Options
```csharp
- enableChairFishingBonus: true/false
- yieldMultiplier: 1.0f - 2.0f (default 1.25f = +25% yield)
- speedMultiplier: 1.0f - 2.0f (default 1.15f = +15% speed)
- requireChairInZone: true/false
- maxChairDistance: 0-5 tiles (default 2)
- showBonusAlert: true/false
```

## User Experience
1. **Immediate Compatibility**: Works with existing chairs from any mod
2. **Clear Feedback**: Optional alert messages when bonuses are granted
3. **Balanced Bonuses**: Modest default bonuses that reward setup without being overpowered
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Users can adjust or disable bonuses as desired

## Files Created
- `Source/ComfortableFishing.cs` - Main mod implementation
- `About/About.xml` - Mod metadata and description
- `About/Preview.png` - Mod preview image
- `Assemblies/ComfortableFishing.dll` - Compiled mod assembly

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with vanilla chairs (armchair, dining chair, etc.)
2. Test with modded furniture (any mod with chairs)
3. Verify bonuses work correctly near fishing zones
4. Check settings menu functionality
5. Confirm alert messages appear when enabled

## Future Enhancement Ideas
If you want to make chairs placeable in shallow water:
1. Create terrain patches for shallow water terrains
2. Add chair affordances to water terrains
3. Potentially create water-specific chair variants

The mod is now ready for use and should work seamlessly with any chair from any mod!

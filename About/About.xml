    <description>Transform your colony's fishing experience into a luxurious, skill-building, zen-like activity! Why stand in the mud when you can catch fish in style?

UNIVERSAL CHAIR COMPATIBILITY
Works with ANY chair from ANY mod - vanilla armchairs, modded thrones, camping chairs, you name it! The mod intelligently detects any sittable furniture.

FISHING BONUSES
• Catch MORE fish (up to 2x yield!)
• Fish FASTER (up to 2x speed!)
• Your pawns will actively seek out chairs for their fishing adventures

WELLNESS and RECREATION
• Gain recreation/joy while peacefully fishing from chairs
• Enjoy maximum comfort levels while seated
• Reduce stress and prevent mental breaks - fishing becomes therapeutic!

SKILL DEVELOPMENT
• Enhanced Animals skill gain (up to 3x multiplier!)
• Gain Intellectual skill from quiet contemplation

FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE
Every bonus can be individually toggled and fine-tuned in the mod settings. Want just the stress relief? No problem! Prefer only the fishing bonuses? You got it! Create your perfect fishing experience.

SMART PLACEMENT
Chairs automatically work when placed near fishing zones (configurable distance). Your pawns will prefer chairs when available, but won't break if none are around.

Perfect for creating peaceful fishing retreats, boosting colony morale, or just making fishing more enjoyable and rewarding!</description>
